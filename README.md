#### Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

- Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!

- It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).

- You need make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). This is a perfect opportunity to apply what you have learned about flexbox.
